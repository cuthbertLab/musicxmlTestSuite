# musicxmlTestSuite
MusicXML Test Suite (Unofficial)

This is a fork of Reinhold Kainhofer's extensive MusicXML test suite 
developed for testing Lilypond's `musicxml2ly` program.  Since it is
useful for lots of music projects that want to support MusicXML
(such as the `music21` project), I've forked it here and invite
contributions of new tests for the future.
